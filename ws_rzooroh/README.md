# Workshop RZooRoh

Authors: Mathieu Gauthier, Pierre Faux and Tom Druet 

## Installation of R libraries

Some libraries require to execute some "tasks"

Further information in the README.md of each workshop.
1. Run the task to install RZooRoh since it is neither available on conda-forge nor bioconda: `pixi run install_rzooroh`
1. Test if the package is loaded correctly from R with another task: `pixi run test rlibs`
    - The text _Package loaded successfully_ should appear on the screen, probably with a warning.
