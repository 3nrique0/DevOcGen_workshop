# Atelier RZooRoH

by Mathieu Gautier and Tom Druet

## To finish the installation of the R libraries

Follow these instructions. Installation can be a bit slow

```
# Install BioC, RZooRoH, SNPRelate
pixi run install_rlibs

# Test installs
pixi run test_rlibs
```

The last command should show no errors and the following statements:

- "Package RZooRoH loaded successfully"
- "Package SNPRelate loaded successfully"
